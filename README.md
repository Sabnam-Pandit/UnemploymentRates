#  Time Series Forecast of Unemployment Rates in United States
## Team Members: Sabnam Pandit,Anatasia Kurakova
## Project Overview:
We analyzed historical unemployment data across the United States to observe patterns, trends,
and seasonality. Statistical algorithms were utilized to make short- term and long-term
predictions. This analysis is crucial as unemployment rates are key economic indicators that
directly impact policymaking, business planning, and personal well-being. Recent research
indicates that unemployment rates have an effect on carbon emissions.Accurate forecasts can
help the government to stabilize the economy during downturns and plan for workforce needs in
periods of growth.For this project we used R-studio to perform data analysis and implement ARIMA statistical
models for forecasting. Our research consists of two parts. First, we looked at the unemployment
rates by state with a focus on California. In the second part, we proceeded with analysis of
overall and gender specific trends in unemployment rates across America.

## Data Description:
For our research we used two datasets from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/axeltorbenson/unemployment-data-19482021/data
This dataset includes unemployment data from the US from 1947-2021. It contains 11 columns
(Date, Unemployment rate for people based on gender and age ranges) and has 887 rows of data
records.The data is tracked on a monthly basis.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/unemployment-in-america-per-us-state/data
This dataset includes unemployment data from the US from 1976-2022. The dataset has 51000
rows and 11 columns. It contains unemployment data for all US states. The data is tracked
monthly. It also contains additional statistics including overall population residing in the area
along with percentage of employable population and unemployment rates. Analysis of this data
could provide us insights into the evolution of unemployment rates for different states across the
country over the past 46 years.
