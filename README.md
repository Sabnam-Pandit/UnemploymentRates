# Exploring Unemployment Rates in the United States - Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project explores the historical unemployment rates in the United States using time series forecasting techniques. The analysis focuses on state-specific trends, gender-based unemployment rates, and overall unemployment trends. The goal is to identify patterns, seasonality, and factors influencing unemployment, and to forecast future unemployment rates using ARIMA and SARIMA models.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the importance of unemployment rates as an economic indicator and the motivation behind the study.
2. **Data Description**: Describes the datasets used for the analysis, including sources and key features.
3. **Methodology**: Details the time series analysis techniques applied, including ARIMA and SARIMA models, and the steps taken to forecast unemployment rates.
4. **Results**: Presents the findings from the analysis, including state-specific trends, gender-based unemployment rates, and overall unemployment trends.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the key findings and implications of the study.

## Datasets

The analysis is based on two datasets:

1. **Unemployment Data (1948-2021)**: Contains monthly unemployment rates in the US from 1948 to 2021. [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/axeltorbenson/unemployment-data-19482021/data).
2. **Unemployment in America per US State (1976-2022)**: Contains monthly unemployment data for all US states from 1976 to 2022. [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/unemployment-in-america-per-us-state/data).

## Key Findings

- **State-Specific Trends**: States like West Virginia exhibited consistently high unemployment rates due to economic reliance on volatile industries, while states like Nebraska demonstrated stability with significantly lower rates.
- **California**: The analysis highlighted the impact of regional economic hubs like Los Angeles on statewide unemployment trends.
- **Gender-Based Unemployment**: The study revealed distinct patterns in unemployment rates between men and women, emphasizing the need for tailored economic policies.
- **Forecasting**: The ARIMA and SARIMA models developed in this study demonstrated robustness in forecasting under normal conditions but struggled to account for outliers caused by extraordinary events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Repository Contents

- **FinalReport_Unemployment.pdf**: The final report detailing the analysis, methodology, and findings.
- **Code**: R scripts used for data analysis and forecasting.
- **Data**: The datasets used in the analysis (not included in the repository due to size, but links are provided above).
